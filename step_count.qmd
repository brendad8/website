title: "Step Counting Project"
---

For this project, we used activity data collected, and labeled by the CalPoly Kinesiology Department to develop a new step counting algorithm. We began by evaluating an existing algorithm developed by the UK Biobank and developed a modified algorithm by leveraging the labeled categories in our dataset that were not included in the UK Biobank data.

This project was done as part of the Data Science Capstone for Cal Poly SLO and was completed under the guidance of Dr. Hunter Glanz, Dr. Jonathan Ventura, and Dr. Sarah Keadle and in collaboration with Martin Hsu, Kirina Sirohi, Jadyn Ellis, and Paige Dolan.

This project was done using `python`.
