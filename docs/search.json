    "text": "For this project, we used linear regression to model housing prices in San Luis Obsipo, California (SLO). We collected created a dataset to analyze by randomly selecting data from Zillow ourselves, choosing from data from properties sold in SLO in a 90-day time span from February 2022 through April 2022. We collected variables such as sold price, square footage, number of beds, baths, and parking spaces, the year the house was built, lot size, home type, and whether or not they had a pool, cooling, or heating on each property in our data set.\nThis project includes exploratory data analysis, transformations, and model building techniques to find a model which best fits the data. Additionally, we performed statistical inference and model validation to answer key research questions and assess the overall model fit. This work was done in collaboration with Martin Hsu and Rachel Roggenkemper.\nThis work was done using R.\nFinal Report"

The ACC is an organization dedicated to improving cardiovascular health by providing healthcare professionals with cutting-edge tools and resources to enhance patient care. While developing our models, we made a constant effort to build models which supported equal outcomes for both male and female patients as there can often be differences in symptoms that lead to unequal outcomes.

The tidyclust package exists as a part of the tidyverse collection of packages to unify implementations for unsupervised learning methods under a common interface that is user-friendly and follows design principles from the tidyverse. The two methods I added were density-based clustering using the DBSCAN algorithm and model-based clustering using Gaussian mixture models. For this work, I had to research each respective method and write code to bring each method into tidyclust, justifying my design choices along the way, which you can read more about in my paper or see in my presentation!\nThesis Paper - Density-Based and Model-Based Clustering with tidyclust in R\nThesis Code - tidyclust Package\nThesis Presentation"

Our experimental design was a completely randomized design with a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) used to analyze the data. This experiment was conducted in collaboration with Brandon Kim and Ken Xie.\nWhile this analysis was done early in our respective college careers, and we have long since grown in our ability to write technical reports, it reinforces the important factors that go into designing an experiment and when statisticians can draw cause and effect conclusions. Looking back, running an experiment with friends was also really fun.\nThe data was analyzed using jmp.\nFinal Report"
