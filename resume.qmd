## Experience


### Inari Medical (Now Stryker)

June 2024 - June 2025

Statistical Programming Intern / Consultant

* Led the development of a custom process for creating analysis datasets in R, with seamless transfer capabilities to SAS,
supporting the potential use of R for production programming over SAS

* Developed a custom QC function in R to standardize dataset validation across the team, incorporating automated checks and
custom functionalities to make QC checks more robust

* Explored the use of a generative AI for common statistical programming tasks to assess its effectiveness, limitations, and
integration potential for future projects

* Supported company clinical research with creation of analysis datasets, tables, listings, and figures using both R and SAS



### First American Title Insurance Company

June 2022 - August 2022

Data & Analytics Intern

* Created reusable SQL procedures summarizing housing data into monthly trends tracking the number of houses for sale, houses sold, new listings, pending sales, and more

* Built an interactive, auto-refreshing dashboard to visualize housing trends, enabling the real-time updates for trends in the housing market

* Cleaned, merged, and validated malformed client and company data across many platforms (SQL Server, Snowflake, Excel), to
answer company and client information needs





## [Projects](projects.qmd)

### [Thesis](thesis.qmd)

June 2025

Density-Based and Model-Based Clustering with `tidyclust` in `R`

* Contributed implementations for DBSCAN and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to the tidyclust package in R, expanding the
package to include density-based and model-based clustering

* Independently researched each method to justify design choices around model arguments, fitting, prediction, and tuning, ensuring each model is self-documenting, user-friendly, and aligned with principles demonstrated in the tidyverse

* Designed a novel way to parameterize different GMM model specifications, enabling users to more easily select model
specifications aligned with their data characteristics

* Implemented a modification to the DBSCAN algorithm to make the algorithm deterministic and return the same cluster
assignments regardless of the order the data was processed


### European Football Leagues Player Profiles Project

February 2023

* Modeled professional soccer player roles based on on-field actions relating to shooting, passing, possession, and defending statistics to identify players based on their on-field actions and playstyle instead of their position

* Performed clustering to identify the different types of play styles for different groups of players, using the cluster centroids to define each cluster with a characteristic name. (Ex. Ball-playing defenders, Midfield destroyers, â€¦)

* Used cosine similarity to identify undervalued players for smaller teams who compare favorably to elite players playing for established teams in Europe indicating a potential for growth when playing in a more dominant team



## Programming Languages

* `R`

* `python`

* `SQL`

* `SAS`

* `java`

* `scala`
