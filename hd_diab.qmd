title: "Detecting Heart Disease and Diabetes Project"
---

The goal of this project was to develop predictive models that can be used to detect diagnoses for diabetes and heart disease in patients This was a mock data science project with the American College of Cardiology (ACC) as the client. The ACC is an organization dedicated to improving cardiovascular health by providing healthcare professionals with cutting-edge tools and resources to enhance patient care. While developing our models, we made a constant effort to build models which supported equal outcomes for both male and female patients as there can often be differences in symptoms that lead to unequal outcomes. This work was completed in collaboration with Rachel Roggenkemper and Jacob Perez.

This project was done using `R` and the `tidymodels` package.
